Graceful degradation is a principle that aims to build apps so that they are still running even in slower or worse conditions. Service workers help allowing web apps to cache assets and intercept network requests. When a connection worsens, the Service workers can send cached data to ensure that the app is still usable even if the connection gets dropped. This works with graceful degradation because it ensures that the app is still functional at its core.
